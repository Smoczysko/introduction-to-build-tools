# Introduction to build tools #

This workspace consists build tools (Ant and Maven) usage examples for series of lectures at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. They are categorized in different directories, one for each tool usage example.

## Structure ##

Each topic (build tool) has it's own directory. Inside it each example has it's own directory named in &lt;example_number&gt;-&lt;topic&gt; pattern. Each example is independent application that can be run without anything else that what's within it.
